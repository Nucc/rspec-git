# Rspec::Git

Creates a git commit after each TDD step. Uses the new specification name to build the commit message. Built to the Ruby based RSpec.

## Installation

    $ gem install rspec-git

## Usage

Extend the spec file with the requirement:

    describe "User" do
      it "should have name" do
        User.new.should respond_to(:name)
      end
    end

After implementing the feature and all of your specs are green, just call the <code>rspec-git</code> command in your project's root directory:

    $ rspec-git

It added the new changes to stage and created a git commit with the following message:

    Added user should have name

If you remove the spec, the generated message will be the following:

    Removed user should have name

Let me know if you have any issue!
